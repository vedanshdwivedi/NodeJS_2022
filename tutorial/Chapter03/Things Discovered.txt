NodeJS is an asynchronus event-driven javascript runtime
The most important components of NodeJS are

- JavaScript V8 Engine
- LibUV [Stores the Node Bindings (fs, http, crypto, path etc, which are written in low-level languages)][Written in C]

Asynchronus Calls Doesn't necessarily runs line by line

JavaScript is a synchronus language, although it does allows us to write code which can be asynchronusly, but it doesn't comes that way out of the box

A. No, JavaScript is a single threaded language
